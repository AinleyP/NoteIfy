## NoteIfy - A piano chord finder application

This is a react application that is hosted on AWS S3. The purpose of this project is to apply my understanding of react towards a personal project. It was also an fun side project for me because sometimes I forget certain chords when jamming out to 2000s R&B songs on the piano ðŸ˜›
